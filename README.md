## Introduction

This project is made for us to experience new web technologies like :
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/fr/)
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)

### Subject

A group of player can sign up as a team and access a map on which are displayed some markers. These markers indicate the location of a question. The team is geolocated throught the web browser and can see its travel on the map. When they are located near a question, it appears on the screen and the user can answer the multiple answers questions and have only one attempt. On success, the team earn some points. Otherwise, they lose some. Teams can answer the questions in the order they want, and have an unlimited amount of time to answer the questions, as long as they stay in the area of the question.
